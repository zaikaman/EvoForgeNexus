## üåü Overview

The Agent Development Kit (ADK) for TypeScript provides a comprehensive framework for building sophisticated AI agents with multi-LLM support, advanced tool integration, memory systems, and flexible conversation flows. Built from the ground up for production use, ADK-TS enables developers to create intelligent, autonomous systems that can handle complex multi-step tasks.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Getting Started

You can get started in two ways:

- **Create a new project with our CLI:**

  ```bash
  npm install -g @iqai/adk-cli
  adk
  ```

- **Add ADK-TS to an existing project:**

  ```bash
  npm install @iqai/adk
  ```

### Simple Example

```typescript
import { AgentBuilder } from "@iqai/adk";

const response = await AgentBuilder
  .withModel("gemini-2.5-flash")
  .ask("What is the capital of France?");

console.log(response);
```

## üß™ Examples

For examples of how to use ADK-TS, check out the [`apps/examples`](https://github.com/IQAIcom/adk-ts/tree/main/apps/examples) directory.

You can run the examples by following these steps:

```bash
# 1. Clone and install the repository
git clone https://github.com/IQAIcom/adk-ts.git
cd adk-ts
pnpm install

# 2. Build the ADK package (required for examples to work)
pnpm build

# 3. Setup API keys
cd apps/examples
echo "GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here" > .env

# 4. Run examples
pnpm start
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: The examples require API keys from at least one LLM provider. The default LLM is Google Gemini. You can get a Google API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).
