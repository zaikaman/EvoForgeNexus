The ADK Runtime is the execution engine that powers agent applications during user interactions. It orchestrates agents, tools, and services through an event-driven architecture.

## Overview

The Runtime serves as the coordination layer that connects all components of your agent application and manages their interactions through a cooperative async generator pattern.

### Core Responsibilities

- **Execution Orchestration**: Coordinate agent, tool, and callback execution
- **Event Processing**: Handle event flow between components
- **State Management**: Manage session state changes and persistence
- **Service Integration**: Connect with LLMs, storage, and external services
- **Resource Management**: Handle lifecycle and resource allocation

<Callout type="info" title="Event-Driven Architecture">
The Runtime operates on events - agents yield events to communicate with the Runner, which processes them and coordinates with services before allowing agents to continue.
</Callout>

## Key Components

The Runtime consists of several key components working together:

**Runner**: The main orchestrator that receives user queries, processes events, and coordinates with services
**Agents**: Execute reasoning logic and yield events to communicate progress
**Events**: Messages that flow between components containing content, actions, and metadata
**Services**: Backend systems for session management, artifacts, and memory

## Quick Start

Here's a basic example of how the Runtime works:

```typescript
import { LlmAgent, Runner, InMemorySessionService } from '@iqai/adk';

// Create an agent
const agent = new LlmAgent({
  name: "assistant",
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  description: "A helpful assistant",
  instruction: "You are a helpful assistant"
});

// Set up runtime components
const sessionService = new InMemorySessionService();
const session = await sessionService.createSession("my_app", "user_123");

const runner = new Runner({
  appName: "my_app",
  agent,
  sessionService
});

// Process user input through the runtime
for await (const event of runner.runAsync({
  userId: "user_123",
  sessionId: session.id,
  newMessage: { parts: [{ text: "Hello!" }] }
})) {
  console.log('Event:', event.author, event.content?.parts);
}
```

## Runtime Features

### Event-Driven Execution

- **Async Generator Pattern**: Cooperative execution between Runner and agents
- **Event Streaming**: Real-time event processing and streaming responses
- **State Consistency**: Guaranteed state consistency through event ordering
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery and graceful degradation

### Service Integration

- **Session Management**: Persistent conversation history and state
- **Artifact Storage**: Binary data and file management
- **Memory Services**: Long-term knowledge storage and retrieval
- **LLM Integration**: Seamless language model interactions

### Scalability & Performance

- **Stateless Execution**: Horizontal scaling support
- **Resource Pooling**: Efficient resource management
- **Monitoring**: Built-in observability and metrics
- **Optimization**: Performance optimization strategies
