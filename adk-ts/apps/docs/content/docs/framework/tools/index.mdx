Tools represent specific capabilities that extend AI agents beyond text generation and reasoning. They enable agents to interact with external systems, perform actions, and access real-time information.

## What Are Tools?

Tools are modular code components that execute distinct, predefined tasks. They bridge the gap between an agent's reasoning capabilities and the external world.

### Key Characteristics

- **Action-Oriented**: Perform specific tasks like API calls, database queries, or file operations
- **Extends Capabilities**: Access real-time information and affect external systems
- **Predefined Logic**: Execute developer-defined functions without independent reasoning
- **Dynamic Usage**: Agents decide which tools to use and when based on context

<Callout type="info" title="Agent vs Tool Responsibilities">
The LLM reasons about which tool to use, when, and with what inputs. The tool itself executes its designated function without independent reasoning.
</Callout>

## How Agents Use Tools

Agents leverage tools through a dynamic process:

1. **Reasoning**: LLM analyzes instructions, context, and user requests
2. **Selection**: Chooses appropriate tools based on available options and descriptions
3. **Invocation**: Generates required arguments and executes the tool
4. **Observation**: Receives and processes the tool's output
5. **Integration**: Incorporates results into ongoing reasoning and response generation

## Tool Types

ADK TypeScript supports several types of tools for different use cases:

## Tool Context & Advanced Features

### Context Access

Tools can access additional contextual information through `ToolContext`:

- **Session State**: Read and modify persistent session data
- **Event Actions**: Control agent flow and behavior after tool execution
- **Authentication**: Handle API credentials and authentication flows
- **Artifacts**: Manage files and documents uploaded or generated
- **Memory**: Search and access long-term user memory

### State Management

Tools can interact with session state to:

- Share data between different tools and agents
- Maintain information across interactions
- Use state prefixes for different scopes (app, user, session, temporary)
- Track state changes automatically

### Flow Control

Tools can influence agent behavior through event actions:

- **Skip Summarization**: Bypass LLM processing when tool output is ready
- **Transfer Control**: Hand off execution to specialized agents
- **Escalate**: Pass control to parent agents in hierarchies
- **Loop Control**: Terminate loops in workflow agents

## Authentication & Security

  />
</Cards>

Tools support various authentication mechanisms:

- **OAuth flows** for secure API access
- **API key management** for service authentication
- **Credential storage** and retrieval
- **Multi-step auth** flows with user interaction

## Best Practices

<Callout type="warn" title="Tool Design Guidelines">
- Use descriptive, action-oriented function names
- Provide clear type hints and parameter descriptions
- Return structured dictionaries with status indicators
- Write comprehensive docstrings for LLM understanding
- Handle errors gracefully with meaningful messages
</Callout>

### Function Design

- **Naming**: Use verb-noun patterns (e.g., `getWeather`, `searchDocuments`)
- **Parameters**: Clear names with proper TypeScript types
- **Returns**: Structured objects with status and error handling
- **Documentation**: Detailed descriptions for LLM decision making

### Error Handling

- **Status Indicators**: Include clear success/error status in responses
- **Error Messages**: Provide actionable error information
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handle failures without breaking agent flow
- **Retry Logic**: Implement appropriate retry mechanisms

### Performance Considerations

- **Async Operations**: Support for long-running operations
- **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect external service limits
- **Timeout Handling**: Implement appropriate timeouts

## Tool Integration Patterns

### Sequential Tool Usage

Tools can be chained together where one tool's output becomes another's input.

### Conditional Tool Selection

Agents can choose different tools based on context and previous results.

### Parallel Tool Execution

Multiple tools can run simultaneously for independent tasks.

### Tool Composition

Complex workflows can combine multiple tool types for sophisticated operations.
