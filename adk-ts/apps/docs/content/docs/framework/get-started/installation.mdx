## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure your development environment meets the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: `v22.0` or higher
- **Package Manager**: `npm`, `yarn`, or
  `pnpm`
- **TypeScript**: `v5.3` or higher (optional but recommended)

## Installation Methods

You can install ADK-TS in two ways: using our CLI for a new project, or adding it manually to an existing one.

### Method 1: Use the CLI (Recommended)

The following command will guide you through creating a new project.

```bash
npx @iqai/adk-cli new
```

You can also install the CLI globally and use it from anywhere:

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  <Tab value="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install -g @iqai/adk-cli
    adk new
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn global add @iqai/adk-cli
    adk new
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add -g @iqai/adk-cli
    adk new
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Method 2: Manual Installation

To add ADK-TS to an existing project, use your preferred package manager:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
  <Tab value="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install @iqai/adk
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add @iqai/adk
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add @iqai/adk
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Common Errors

If you run into trouble, here are a few common issues and their solutions:

<Callout type="warn" title="Node.js Version Mismatch">
  Errors during installation are often caused by an incompatible Node.js
  version. Verify you are using `v22.0` or higher: `node --version`
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn" title="TypeScript Compatibility">
  For TypeScript projects, using a version lower than `v5.3` may cause
  type-related errors. Check your version with: `npx tsc --version`
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn" title="API Key Configuration Issues">
  If you get authentication errors, ensure:
  - You have imported and configured dotenv in your agent file:
    ```typescript
    import * as dotenv from "dotenv";
    dotenv.config();
    ```
  - Your API key is correctly set in the `.env` file
  - You have access to the model you're trying to use
  - The `.env` file is in the project root directory
</Callout>

## Next Steps

Now that you have ADK-TS installed, you're ready to start building. Where to next?
