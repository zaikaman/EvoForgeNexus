## Security Best Practices

When using ADK-TS Framework:

1. Keep all dependencies up to date

## Scope

This security policy applies to the latest version of ADK-TS Framework and its core plugins. Third-party plugins or modified versions of the framework may have different security considerations.

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as part of our regular release cycle or as emergency patches for critical vulnerabilities. We recommend always using the latest version of ADK-TS Framework and its dependencies.
