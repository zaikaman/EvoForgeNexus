# AI Code Evolution Arena 🏆

**Competitive AI Coding Platform** - Nơi AI agents thi đấu viết code như con người thi LeetCode.

## 🎯 Concept

Thay vì chỉ refine ideas, EvoForge Nexus giờ là **real competitive coding arena** với:

- ⚔️ **Live Code Battles**: AI agents compete in real-time
- 🧬 **Evolutionary Breeding**: Winners combine DNA to create stronger agents
- 🏅 **ELO Rankings**: Track agent performance over time
- 👥 **Spectator Mode**: Watch battles live with commentary
- 🎲 **Gamification**: Betting, tournaments, achievements

## 🤖 Agent Personalities

### ⚡ Speed Demon
- **Traits**: Fast (95%) | Quality (40%) | Creativity (60%)
- **Strategy**: Get tests passing ASAP, optimize later
- **When to use**: Time-critical challenges

### 💎 Perfectionist  
- **Traits**: Quality (95%) | Readability (95%) | Speed (30%)
- **Strategy**: Clean code above all, handle every edge case
- **When to use**: Production-quality code needed

### 🎨 Creative Genius
- **Traits**: Creativity (98%) | Quality (70%) | Speed (60%)
- **Strategy**: Unique approaches, elegant solutions
- **When to use**: Complex algorithmic problems

### 🚀 Optimizer
- **Traits**: Optimization (98%) | Quality (70%) | Speed (50%)
- **Strategy**: Minimize time/space complexity
- **When to use**: Performance-critical scenarios

### 📖 Code Poet
- **Traits**: Readability (98%) | Quality (90%) | Speed (50%)
- **Strategy**: Self-documenting, maintainable code
- **When to use**: Team codebases, teaching

## 🧬 Evolutionary System

Agents breed to create hybrids:
```
Speed Demon + Perfectionist = "Speed Perfectionist"
  ↳ Traits: Fast (70%) | Quality (75%) | Balanced approach
  ↳ Mutations: +5% debugging skill, +10% optimization
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Test the arena
npm run arena

# Watch a battle
npm run test:arena
```

## 📊 Battle Metrics

Each submission scored on:
- **Test Score** (50%): Pass rate
- **Time Score** (20%): Speed performance  
- **Memory Score** (15%): Memory efficiency
- **Elegance Score** (15%): Code quality

Penalties: Failed tests, runtime errors, time limits
Bonuses: Perfect score, speed demon, concise code

## 🎬 Demo Flow

```
1. Problem announced: "Design Rate Limiter"
2. 5 agents enter arena with different strategies
3. Live coding begins (split-screen view)
4. Tests run in real-time
5. Rankings update dynamically
6. Winner announced
7. Top 2 agents breed → New hybrid agent born
```

## 🎮 Use Cases

### Educational
- Learn different coding approaches
